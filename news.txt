WE ARE JUVENTUS ONE
It’s not just football.
It’s a story of life, courage, and belonging.

Juventus One is a sports and social project — but it’s also much more than that: a family that grows together, trains in trust, and learns to recognize itself in a look, a gesture, a jersey.

These are eleven stories.
Eleven portraits of men who, on and off the pitch,
have found in football a starting point, not a destination.
There are those who have discovered the strength to change,
those who have found themselves again,
and those who have learned that a team is a way to feel alive.

Each of them carries a victory that isn’t counted in goals,
but in the courage to show up — always, no matter what.
There are steps forward, goals defended, and smiles shared.
There’s the quiet beauty of those who play the game of life
with loyalty, commitment, and heart.

Because when you wear this jersey,
when you walk onto the field with others,
you’re no longer just a player — you’re part of something greater.

These are true stories.
These are stories of football, of people, of team spirit.
These are the stories of Juventus One.
